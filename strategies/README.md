## SendTelegramMsg.cs
This is just the simplest way to get alerts from NinjaTrader in your telegram bot.\

I taked the example at Quantower GitHub code for a simple moving average cross trade with the Telegram message alert.
https://github.com/Quantower/Examples/blob/master/Strategies/SimpleMACross.cs

Replace from the input parameters: 
* the Telegram ID by your ID  (@RawDataBot start then type anything and it will show your ID)
* the Telegram Token by the token of your bot where you will get the messages (@BotFather -> start -> /newbot -> type the bot name and it will show you the token)
