## Risk Disclosure

***Futures, stocks and forex trading contains substantial risk and is not for every investor. An investor could potentially lose all or more than the initial investment. Risk capital is money that can be lost without jeopardizing onesâ€™ financial security or life style. Only risk capital should be used for trading and only those with sufficient risk capital should consider trading. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.***
<br />

## CFTC RULE 4.41

***Hypothetical or simulated performance results have a certain limitations. Unlike an actual performance record, simulated results do not represent actual trading. Also, since the trades may not have been executed, the results may have under-or-over compensated for the impact, if any, of certain market factors, such as lack of liquidity. Simulated trading programs, in general, can also be subject to the fact that they are designed with the benefit of hindsight. No representation is being made that any account will or is likely to achieve profit or losses similar to those shown.***
