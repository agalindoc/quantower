Indicators and strategies for Quantower trading platform (C#)

You will find 3 files for each indicator\
**cs** file is the source code

If you are not a developer and want to use the indicator you can download the **dll** and **pdb** extension files

Copy them on a new folder inside your Quantower strategy location, example, mine is:\
**C:\Users\Alejandro\Downloads\AMP Quantower\Settings\Scripts\Indicators\**

inside Indicators folder create a new one, example, for "Order Flow Tools" i will create a folder called the same "Order Flow Tools", now we have the next folder location:\
**C:\Users\Alejandro\Downloads\AMP Quantower\Settings\Scripts\Indicators\Order Flow Tools\**

Here copy the **dll** and **pdb** files
